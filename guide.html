<h1>Maze Solving Rulebook</h1>

<h2>1. Purpose of the Maze</h2>
<p>
The objective of this maze is to identify a continuous, valid path from the
<strong>designated starting point</strong> to the
<strong>designated exit point</strong> by navigating through interconnected
corridors while strictly following the defined rules. The maze tests logical
reasoning, spatial awareness, and problem-solving skills.
</p>

<h2>2. Maze Structure</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The maze consists of interconnected pathways separated by solid walls</li>
  <li>All pathways are of uniform width</li>
  <li>All walls are impassable</li>
  <li>The maze has one valid entry point and one valid exit point</li>
  <li>No hidden passages, movable walls, or shortcuts exist</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Starting and Ending Rules</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The solver must begin at the marked starting position</li>
  <li>The solver must finish at the designated exit point</li>
  <li>Entering the maze from any other location is not permitted</li>
  <li>Exiting the maze at any point other than the designated exit is invalid</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Movement Rules</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Movement is allowed only through open pathways</li>
  <li>The solver may move forward, backward, left, or right</li>
  <li>Diagonal movement is strictly prohibited</li>
  <li>The solver must remain within maze corridors at all times</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Prohibited Actions (Don’ts)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>❌ Crossing, touching, or cutting through walls</li>
  <li>❌ Lifting writing tools to skip sections (if physically solving)</li>
  <li>❌ Marking or altering maze walls</li>
  <li>❌ Creating new paths or modifying existing ones</li>
  <li>❌ Using external aids unless explicitly allowed</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Allowed Actions (Do’s)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>✔ Tracing the path continuously within corridors</li>
  <li>✔ Backtracking when a dead end is reached</li>
  <li>✔ Pausing and resuming, provided continuity is maintained</li>
  <li>✔ Using logical strategies such as wall-following</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. Solution Validity Criteria</h2>
<p>
A solution is considered valid only if:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The path begins at the official start point</li>
  <li>The path ends at the official exit point</li>
  <li>The path remains entirely within maze corridors</li>
  <li>No walls are crossed or violated</li>
  <li>All movement rules are followed</li>
</ul>

<h2>8. Time and Attempts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The maze may be solved with or without a time limit</li>
  <li>Multiple attempts are allowed unless stated otherwise</li>
  <li>Only the final completed path is evaluated</li>
</ul>

<h2>9. Ethical and Fair Play Guidelines</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Solvers must rely on their own reasoning and skill</li>
  <li>Copying pre-solved paths or automated solvers is discouraged</li>
  <li>Fair play and honesty are expected</li>
</ul>

<h2>10. Conclusion</h2>
<p>
This maze is designed to promote logical thinking, patience, and structured
problem-solving. Successful completion depends on careful navigation,
adherence to rules, and disciplined exploration.
